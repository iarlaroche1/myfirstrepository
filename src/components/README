    v-model creates two-way data binding between an HTML element (like input, textarea, or select) and a Vue data property.
    When the user interacts with the element, the corresponding data variable is automatically updated, and if the data variable is updated, the element's value will reflect that change.
    It simplifies working with forms and inputs by reducing the need for manually managing updates to both the UI and the data.

    Firebaseâ€™s onCall functions are more convenient when working within the Firebase ecosystem, especially if you're building apps that rely on Firebase Authentication and want to avoid managing CORS or HTTP methods manually. They provide a cleaner, more integrated experience for developers who are building Firebase-based apps. On the other hand, onRequest functions are better suited when you need full control over HTTP methods and routing or need to integrate with third-party services.
